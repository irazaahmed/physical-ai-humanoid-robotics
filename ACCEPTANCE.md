# Acceptance Checks for Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Files Created and Verified

### Content Generation Checks
- [X] docusaurus/docs/module1/intro.md created with proper frontmatter and content
- [X] docusaurus/docs/module1/ros-overview.md created with proper frontmatter and content
- [X] docusaurus/docs/module1/nodes-topics-services.md created with proper frontmatter and content
- [X] docusaurus/docs/module1/rclpy-basics.md created with proper frontmatter and content
- [X] docusaurus/docs/module1/urdf-intro.md created with proper frontmatter and content
- [X] docusaurus/docs/module1/lab1-pubsub.md created with proper frontmatter and content
- [X] docusaurus/docs/module1/lab2-controller.md created with proper frontmatter and content
- [X] docusaurus/docs/module1/quiz.md created with proper frontmatter and content
- [X] docusaurus/docs/module1/references.md created with proper frontmatter and content
- [X] docusaurus/docs/module1/appendix-hardware-lite.md created with proper frontmatter and content

### Frontmatter Verification
- [X] Each file contains required frontmatter keys: doc_id, title, module, estimated_tokens, embedding_required, chunk_hint_tokens
- [X] doc_id values match the requirements: project1_m1_ch01 through project1_m1_ch10
- [X] All files contain the embedding placeholder comment near the top

### Content Requirements Verification
- [X] intro.md and ros-overview.md include at least one code snippet each
- [X] lab1-pubsub.md includes rclpy example and runnable commands
- [X] All files contain required content elements: objective, learning outcomes, theory, exercises, quiz questions
- [X] All files are under 3000 words as required

### Technical Accuracy Checks
- [X] All code snippets in lab exercises are valid and runnable
- [X] File paths are correctly specified according to the requirements
- [X] Content stays within Module 1 scope (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- [X] No bonus features (RAG, auth, Urdu, subagents) were added

### Quality Checks
- [X] All code examples are appropriate for educational purposes
- [X] Content pedagogically sound with clear learning outcomes
- [X] Labs include safe, minimal examples that can be run locally
- [X] Technical concepts accurately represented

## Summary
All Module 1 textbook files have been generated according to the requirements specified in the implementation plan. Each file includes the required frontmatter, contains appropriate content for teaching ROS 2 fundamentals, and stays within the scope of Project 1.
