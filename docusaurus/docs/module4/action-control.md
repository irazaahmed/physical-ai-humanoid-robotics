# Action Planning and Execution

## Learning Objective
Implement motor planning and execution systems for humanoid robot control based on perception and language.

## Key Concepts
- Motion planning algorithms
- Motor control and coordination
- Task planning and decomposition
- Safety and collision avoidance
- Real-time action execution

## Lab/Practical
Create an action execution system that translates high-level commands into specific humanoid robot movements.
