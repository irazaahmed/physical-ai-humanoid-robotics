# Lab 2: Unity Robotics Simulation

## Learning Objective
Build and test a simple robot simulation in Unity environment.

## Key Concepts
- Scene setup and environment creation
- Physics configuration and parameters
- Sensor simulation and visualization
- Control system implementation
- Integration with external systems

## Lab/Practical
Create the same robot model in Unity, add sensors, and implement basic navigation.
