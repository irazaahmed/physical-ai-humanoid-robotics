# Comparison of Simulation Environments

## Learning Objective
Compare and contrast different simulation approaches and their use cases in robotics.

## Key Concepts
- Physics accuracy vs. visual fidelity trade-offs
- Real-time vs. offline simulation capabilities
- Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation
- Performance characteristics of different platforms
- Use case selection criteria for simulation platforms

## Lab/Practical
Run the same robot model in both Gazebo and Unity and compare behaviors and performance.
